I am at once a young girl and a dying woman. In many ways, I am blocked - existing in a perpetual state of stuckness, rigidity, coercion - a cube of sorts. Some people are spherical. I am not one of them. In many other ways, I am completely fine. I am alive, and it is interesting enough.

I see this blog as a vessel: a container for my thoughts, musings, and oddities. My vision of a healthy society is one where everyone feels alive and good – in other words, one where everyone is doing whatever their soul calls of them. The soul is a mighty force. You can coerce yourself and contort yourself into one hundred different shapes, and the soul will use all its might to return to its original form.

This is my attempt to return to original form. 

with love,

S
