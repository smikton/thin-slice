# January

* I woke up in a small cabin in Grandson, where I'd decided to spend the new years alone due to my previous new years plans involving my ex. It was peaceful, although I did start to feel a bit lonely. 
* It was the first day in almost 1.5 years not sending a poll. This felt fine until the end of January, when I noticed I missed my polls, and had not a coherent reason for ending them. 
* I came home for a few days, before heading off to Casa Tilo in Spain - a coliving community I found through the tpot network on Twitter. I spent ~ two weeks there, and it really was lovely. I felt like my nervous system relaxed and remained at a steady level for the first time in months. I desperately needed a change of scenery.



* Woke up on Jan 1st in an isolated cabin alone in [Grandson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandson,_Switzerland), by the lake, watched the birds above the lake, tried to take in where i was in life. Do i really enjoy being alone? Yes, sadly. 
* This was december, but ill mark it as Jan: i finished my 468 day long polling project 
* Spent two weeks at Casa Tilo - met some really kidn humans
* Fell in love with Claude code, built a personal blog 
* * This was a highlight of my month, seeing something go from idea > reality, having an outlet to write freely, but form-ly than in a journal, longer than twitter, more private than substakc (too many vessels!) 
* Started my MitX course, felt parts of my brain that had not been used for yeras, oscillated between laziness because why would i learn to code R anymore, and discovering which bits were useful. I thought to myself - why am i doing this, what am i actually interested in? I think I was first inspired by my plls 
* * Cheated too much, decided to actually think 
* Finished applying to all 4 of my masters programs, heard back from 1 (UCL, accepted)
* * All were a mix of sociology/behavioral science/data science/social research  
* Cancelled a trip to Munich/Berlin because of Chomage appointments 
* Read a decent amount, read 7 books - including my new favourite book of all time, “the hour of the star”
* Started new routines, did morning pages every day, 30 minutes of meditation 
* sTarted running again for the first time in maybe 5 years? No longer coughing blood
* The visa phrase “what you do is what you do” was maybe the motto of the month. Id be laying on the carpet, thinking - should i go for a run. And then i’d say, what you do is what you do. If you go on a run you are someone who runs. If you stay on the carpet you are someone who stays on the carpet. And this was incredibly motivating 
* Dealt drugs, rekindled a friendhsip (?) with V, who is super lovely > made me want to meet new friends 
* Updated my CV, applied to chomage, and started job-hutning 
* * Felt pretty sad at the job prospects available in geneva, all the comms roles involve essentially social media posting, everything else  is mega status gated (ie without a masters, many roles not possible) - makes me sad about the state of the world, where are the interesting people and jobs? 

  * Felt proud of my cv and life so far, and then had claude remind me that i am mediocre and not impressive 

  * The deeper issue, he said, was that my cv contains nothing that i am proud of , or actually enjoy doing - 
* STarted working on a “time off doc - with plans for how to use this time off well”
* Worked tireless ly on two blog posts, but struggled to finish them into coherent form. I finished the draft of one, and then my brother reminded me how much work it needed. 
* Helped my grandma reorganize her entire password system. Reflected on the state of being an elderly person, and what I would want if I was her. 
* I think the biggest things so far has been a) sitting through triggers b) re-encountering the muscle of “what makes me motivated” - ie reading books and highlgihting beautiful quotes, or spending hours iterating with claude code until we get something just right
* I’ve been re-aquainted with how good it feels to “build something”. I think this is all i really wnat. 
* Stopped therapy for a while after therapy overloading in february. Literally texted my therapist i have nothing to say right now. Felt good to just breathe a bit. I think the mind can sense when it has done too much paralysis. 
* I got a desk! I haven’t had a desk in maybe 5 years? It is a game changer. I thought working off various tables was just as good, but the step change from table to desk has been wonderful. 
* Muddled through a confusing breakup (?) 

**Main themes**

* Emotional okayness > how to live through a trigger
* Slop - I believe much of my aversion to publishing things online comes from a belief that most of what is out there is slop (in addition to fear of failure, etc) - but seriously what are we to do
* Selfishness - its funny i spent the last nearly 4 years around people concerned with “how to do the most good” and never once did it occur to me to ask myself that question, because frankly, i assumed these people were doing very little good - and now i ask myself that question again - how can i do good? 
* Motivation 
* Being single (?) 

**Things on my mind**

* Triggered
* Doing good > why is leaving EA the first time it feels like i seriously think about this?
