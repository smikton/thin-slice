# January 

* I woke up in a small cabin in Grandson, where I'd decided to spend the new years alone due to my previous new years plans involving my ex. It was peaceful, although I did start to feel a bit lonely. 
* It was the first day in almost 1.5 years not sending a poll. This felt fine until the end of January, when I noticed I missed my polls, and had not a coherent reason for ending them. 
* I came home for a few days, before heading off to Casa Tilo in Spain - a coliving community I found through the tpot network on Twitter. I spent ~ two weeks there, and it really was lovely. I felt like my nervous system relaxed and remained at a steady level for the first time in months. I desperately needed a change of scenery.
