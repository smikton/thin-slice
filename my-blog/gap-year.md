title: Gap Year
permalink: /gap-year/
---
I am dubbing this year a gap year, or gap roughly 8 months, assuming I get into grad school starting in September. I quit my job at the end of last year, because I was not feeling motivated, and I feel like I've been dreading the type of work I've been doing

Success would look something like

\> I meet new people, both peresonally and proifesaionaly. Professionaly: I actually reach out to interesting people I'd like to talk to (Professors, researchers, community builders, writers, etc etc). Would be cool to aim for ~10 reach outs? I would like to expand my bubble too, outside the EA-verse, the AI-verse, different ages, different worldviews. E.g. if im interested in expanding my polling project, i coudl reach out to a surveyist and ask them about their work. If im interested in AI ethics, I could reach out to a ressearcher. 

\> I write stuff and make stuff and host stuff. I share some of it publically, and hopefully some could exist on my CV. 

\> I take courses about things I find interesting. Currently, unforutnately, interested in AI, writing, ethics, sociology, societal impacts of AI, human behavior/psychology, agency, decision-making. 

\> I get some things done I've been meaning to do for a long time (upskilling in french, freezing my eggs, maybe getting my drivers liscense). 

\> I do some sort of volunteering, fellowship, apprenticeship - something a bit legible, something that gives me a container to do stuf.f 

\> I figure out the rough direction of research I'd like to do during my masters. 

\> I apply and get into masters. 

\> I feel alive and okay. 

## January 2026

* Woke up on Jan 1st in an isolated cabin alone in [Grandson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandson,_Switzerland), by the lake, watched the birds above the lake, tried to take in where i was in life. It was the first day not sending a poll in around 1.5 years. 
* This was december, but ill mark it as Jan: i finished my 468 day long polling project 
* Spent two weeks at Casa Tilo - met some really kidn humans
* Fell in love with Claude code, built a personal blog 
* * This was a highlight of my month, seeing something go from idea > reality, having an outlet to write freely, but form-ly than in a journal, longer than twitter, more private than substakc (too many vessels!) 
* Started my MitX course, felt parts of my brain that had not been used for yeras, oscillated between laziness because why would i learn to code R anymore, and discovering which bits were useful. I thought to myself - why am i doing this, what am i actually interested in? I think I was first inspired by my plls 
* * Cheated too much, decided to actually think 
* Finished applying to all 4 of my masters programs, heard back from 1 (UCL, accepted)
* * All were a mix of sociology/behavioral science/data science/social research  
* Cancelled a trip to Munich/Berlin because of Chomage appointments 
* Read a decent amount, read 7 books - including my new favourite book of all time, “the hour of the star”
* Started new routines, did morning pages every day, 30 minutes of meditation 
* sTarted running again for the first time in maybe 5 years? No longer coughing blood
* The visa phrase “what you do is what you do” was maybe the motto of the month. Id be laying on the carpet, thinking - should i go for a run. And then i’d say, what you do is what you do. If you go on a run you are someone who runs. If you stay on the carpet you are someone who stays on the carpet. And this was incredibly motivating. 
* Dealt drugs, rekindled a friendhsip (?) with V, who is super lovely > made me want to meet new friends 
* Updated my CV, applied to chomage, and started job-hutning 
* * Felt pretty sad at the job prospects available in geneva, all the comms roles involve essentially social media posting, everything else  is mega status gated (ie without a masters, many roles not possible) - makes me sad about the state of the world, where are the interesting people and jobs? 

  * Felt proud of my cv and life so far, and then had claude remind me that i am mediocre and not impressive 

  * The deeper issue, he said, was that my cv contains nothing that i am proud of , or actually enjoy doing - 
* STarted working on a “time off doc - with plans for how to use this time off well”. I realized that the very act of creating such a document was counter to the spirit of what I wanted to do. I was trying to re-engineer how I could make my CV look good after htis time off, rather than just - following my interests month by month and trusting that cool things would come out of this. 
* Worked tireless ly on two blog posts, but struggled to finish them into coherent form. I finished the draft of one, and then my brother reminded me how much work it needed. 
* Helped my grandma reorganize her entire password system. Reflected on the state of being an elderly person, and what I would want if I was her. 
* I think the biggest things so far has been a) sitting through triggers b) re-encountering the muscle of “what makes me motivated” - ie reading books and highlgihting beautiful quotes, or spending hours iterating with claude code until we get something just right
* I’ve been re-aquainted with how good it feels to “build something”. I think this is all i really wnat. 
* Stopped therapy for a while after therapy overloading in february. Literally texted my therapist i have nothing to say right now. Felt good to just breathe a bit. I think the mind can sense when it has done too much paralysis. 
* I got a desk! I haven’t had a desk in maybe 5 years? It is a game changer. I thought working off various tables was just as good, but the step change from table to desk has been wonderful. 
* Spoke with Chiara about launching a writers retreat - more to come in the February recap. 

At the end of the month, I had a bit of a freak out, wondering what the hell I was doing with my life. I am trying to both hedge for a world in which I remain legible in the world of CVs and one where I explore my interests and these worldsd often don't seem compatible. But I was reminded that ... I think, I can sense when something feels meanintful, because I am genuinely curious, I am absored, I am excited. I want to fill my time with these things. There is this frantic, "must-do" energy. There is this trap I fall into, where I have so many ideas of what to do that I end up doing none of them. I am learning that it is far better to find one thing that seems genuinely abosrbing and doing as much of that as possible. 

When I panic, I panic. I start applying for jobs in International Geneva, miserable sounding jobs where I'm required ot have a masters in communications in order to be a social media associate, as if posting on social media is a skill that must be gated by a masters degree. I get frustrated at the rigidity of the world, and of Europe especially. That they still do not do work tests, but ask for CVs and generic cover letters. Why is no one working to change this? 

**Main themes**

* Emotional okayness > how to live through a trigger
* Slop - I believe much of my aversion to publishing things online comes from a belief that most of what is out there is slop (in addition to fear of failure, etc) - but seriously what are we to do
* Selfishness - its funny i spent the last nearly 4 years around people concerned with “how to do the most good” and never once did it occur to me to ask myself that question, because frankly, i assumed these people were doing very little good - and now i ask myself that question again - how can i do good? 
* Motivation 
* Being single (?) 

**Things on my mind**

* Triggered
* Doing good > why is leaving EA the first time it feels like i seriously think about this?
