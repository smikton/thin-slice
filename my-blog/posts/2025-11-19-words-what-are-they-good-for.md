title: Words, what are they good for?
date: 2025-12-19

I would like to live in a wordless world. I would like to get rid of language, of concepts, of thought. What good has a “concept” ever done? I can’t think of a single thing.

I would like to get a lobotomy to remove my inner monologue. I imagine waking up from my monologue-removal-brain-surgery in an anesthetic state of bliss, washed over in a peaceful quietude. Gone would be the days of rumination, doubt, and overthinking - in their place, a meadow of sensations, colours, and imaginary lands. 

I wish humans did not need to speak to one another. I wish we had no way to know whether an experience was shared, if my inner world felt like yours or not. I would not need to tell you how much I loved you – I would feel it, and you would too. 

I wish for things to simply be, not to have to mean. I am tired of ascribing things, and defining things, and explaining things. Labels tire me; they tire of us too. What a wretched curse god granted to us – this gift of “thought”.

I am tired of thinking, of speaking, of analyzing. I wish for quiet, I wish for peace. I would like to live in a wordless world.
