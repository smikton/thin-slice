I've been thinking about language lately. Not in the academic sense—I don't care about syntax or morphology or whatever linguists concern themselves with. I mean language as this weird, insufficient tool we're all stuck using to communicate things that probably can't be communicated.

Someone tells you they're sad, and you think you know what they mean because you've been sad too. But their sad and your sad are completely different experiences, filtered through different bodies, different histories, different chemical compositions. We just pretend the words mean the same thing because otherwise we'd be completely alone.

The other day I tried to explain to a friend why I like spending time alone, and everything I said felt wrong. "I need to recharge" makes me sound like a battery. "I value solitude" makes me sound pretentious. "I just don't want to be around people" makes me sound misanthropic. None of these are quite right, but I don't have better words, so I pick the least-wrong one and hope they'll understand.

Maybe this is why I write. Not because I think I'm good at it, but because trying to find the right words feels like the closest I can get to actually saying what I mean. Even when I fail—especially when I fail—there's something honest in the attempt.

Words are terrible. Words are all we have. So we keep trying.
