I stumbled across my favourite book of all time recently, which is a lovely feeling. It left me giggling and a bit in awe. As R Bartlett says, much writing nowadays seems to regress to the mean - which means, basically it all sounds the same. Mine included. I don't think one can escape this unless you leave society. Anyways I wanted to share some of my favourite quotes from this book because i just loved it so much.
