It feels quite disorientating to be alive right now. Especially if you spend an unhealthy amount of time on twitter. 

It is lovely logging onto Twitter in the morning, after having quit my job, (in AI policy, no less!) and reading: [“If you have a job right now, do everything you can to hold on to it”. ](https://x.com/BoringBiz_/status/2019414912552878526)The thing is, “you can just do things” applies to being an idiot, too. In truth, I quit because I have been slowly withering away and felt it important to try to feel alive again. But I do not really know how to orient myself. 

**Freaky ones**

[“It would therefore be wise to expect 2026 to be a more rapid year of AI progress than all years that have come before. Indeed, this is probably the conservative forecast at this point.” ](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/on-recursive-self-improvement-part)

[“I guess there's maybe a 10-20% chance of AI causing human extinction in the coming decades, but I feel more distressed about it than even that suggests—I think because in the case where it doesn't cause human extinction, I find it hard to imagine life not going kind of off the rails ... Even if we don't die, it still feels like everything is coming to an end.”](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.substack.com/p/the-other-side-of-the-tidal-wave)

[“So the question is how to survive what is looking to be a decade of white collar disruption with a plan to get back on the horse when the next opportunity comes around. Or do you opt out and leave it all behind (… and for what?)”](https://x.com/michaelmiraflor/status/2019426847885521369)

“[Went out to lunch. People were smiling and enjoying their day. But they don’t know that accountants are going away. Lawyers. Radiologists. Journalists. Marketers. Gig workers. Factory workers. Long-haul truckers. Developers ](https://x.com/buccocapital/status/2019470699765625032)

**Positive ones**

[Market signal: many of the best folks at AI labs that have left for their own thing recently are working on AI for science. (Also, "hobby is hiking in wilderness for weeks" is a very positive signal as well, as far as I'm concerned! Good luck!)](https://x.com/Afinetheorem/status/2019536002256368040)
