title: Planned Software Updates to My Psyche for 2026

The psyche is surprisingly malleable, apparently. I hope to test this hypothesis this year, with hopes to release the following product updates:

**1. Feeling genuine happiness for other people**

Much of my unhappiness stems from finding joy excruciating to witness. When someone else has good news, gets a new job, announces an engagement, or is simply just shares that they are enjoying life, I often feel incredibly, deeply sad. All good things point to some lack in me, resulting in this twisted \*\** where I often kind of feel better knowing that other people are not doing that great.

This sucks. It is especially sucky when trying to deal with heartbreak. My ex said he would feel deeply happy if I found love. I told him I would be utterly and absolutely devastated if he found love. This is quite normal, but also, I do not want to live this way.

I would like to be able to feel happy for other people. If my exes find happiness and fulfillment, I would like to feel joy for them. I would like for other peoples' good news to fuel me and a deeper optimism in humanity. 

I believe this requires:
a) understanding that life is not a zero sum game; that good things are not finite. A good thing happening to someone else does not automatically imply that you are deficient in some important way.
b) loving yourself. Many things are downstream of wanting to feel loved. And many things *feel* like a reminder that you are not loved (an ex moving on, someone else getting engaged while you are still single, etc.). If you are able to produce a constant reservoir of self-love somewhere deep within you, a belief that you really are okay in your current form, the pangs of sadness will not feel so bad, I imagine. This is also where God comes in, I think. Apparently God loves you infinitely, as you are. That is pretty good stuff. 

An apt example: your partner provides you with safety, they make you feel loved. When they leave, you no longer feel loved. They move on, they fall in love with someone else. You feel horrific pain, your body interprets this as: you are not loved / do not deserve love. The thing is, love is most pure when you do not cling to your partner, or to a thing they provide you, but when you are really okay with yourself, and they with themselves, and you both just love each other for some ineffable reason and are drawn to each other utterly and completely ***as you are*.** They will, inevitably, provide wonderful things, like safety, and comfort, and care, but you do not love them ***because*** they provide these things!!! 

**2. Not flinching away** 

Often, "bad feelings" are so bad that you subconsciously find a million ways to distract yourself, with online chess, YouTube videos, moving countries, rather than actually sitting and feeling the feeling you do not want to feel. I have spent years avoiding feelings. Most humans have. However, the pain of actually sitting with the thing you are avoiding is often far less painful than the suffering that emerges from avoiding this feeling. Feel your feelings.

**3. Internalizing "There is the perception of infinity, rather than reality of it"**

I do not like feeling bad. I feel bad very often. Badness often manifests in very bodily ways - intense tightness in the chest, 

I very frequently encounter "bad feeling". I am a moody person, I feel things deeply, it not unsuprising for me to spiral on the daily, have panic attacks, go from feeling a manic euphoria to a horrific sadness and fear in the swings of an hour. Much of my sadness has stemmed from not wanting this to be the case. I hate it. When I am in "bad feeling" land, I do not fundamnetllay believe this place is escapable. 

* Believing in myself - 

**4. Not Dwelling in Misrery**

I am someone who was born to feel things deeply. This can be a beautiful gift, btu for most of my life I've seen this as a curse. I am victim to horrific mood swings, panic spirals, manic episodes turning into depresseive days. I fidn this,s omewhere deep down, quite unfair. When I see people's annual mood tracker data showing their average mood was an 8+ and they only had two days that reached as low as a 4, I wonder - what the fuck??? I realized, recently, that I want other people to feel bad for me. Perhas because bpity feels like care and love, or attention, I am not sure. 

I would like to complain less. I would like to broadcast my misery less. I imagine I will spend my life feeling things deeply, remaining deeply emotional - but I would love to cope with this alone. 

c) sometimes you will just be sad. This too, is inevitbale. You yearn for partnership, but you are alone. You want menaingful work, but you keep finding yourself in boring office jobs. Acknoweldging this, feeling it, and being like - hey this is what I got. Dwelling in pain, amplifying my misery to engender pity (which feels like love), is not a good long-term strategy. Deal with the cards you have, and make the most of it.
