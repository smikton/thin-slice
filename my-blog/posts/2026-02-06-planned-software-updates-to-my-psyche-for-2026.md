title: Planned software updates to my psyche for 2026

The psyche is surprisingly malleable, apparently. I hope to test this hypothesis this year, with plans to release the following updates:

**1. Feeling genuine happiness for other people**

Much of my unhappiness stems from finding joy excruciating to witness. When I see someone share good news, achieve something impressive, or simply announce that they are enjoying life, I reflexively begin to feel incredibly, deeply sad. All good things point to some lack in me, resulting in this twisted dynamic where I often prefer knowing other people are not doing very well. 

This sucks. It especially sucks when trying to deal with heartbreak. My ex said he would feel deeply happy if I found love. I told him I would be utterly and absolutely devastated if he found love. This is quite normal, but also, I do not want to live this way.

I would like to be able to feel happy for other people. I would like for other people's good news to fuel me and a deeper optimism in humanity.

I believe this requires:

a) understanding that life is not a zero sum game; that good things are not finite. A good thing happening to someone else does not imply that you are deficient in some important way, or that fewer good things await you. 

b) loving yourself. Many things are downstream of wanting to feel loved. And many things *feel* like a reminder that you are not loved (an ex moving on, a friend getting engaged while you are still single, etc.). If you are able to produce a constant reservoir of self-love somewhere deep within you, a belief that you really are okay in whichever form you take, the pangs of sadness will not feel so bad. This also, ironically, makes you more receptive to love when it does come along (yes, "when" - not "if"). 

**An apt example:** you're in a budding relationship, with a partner who makes you feel deeply loved and safe. Your relationship ends, they move on, and fall in love with someone else. You feel a horrific, crushing pain, because your body interprets this as: you are not loved / you do not deserve love. The thing is, love is most pure when you do not cling to your partner, or to something they provide you, but when you are really okay with yourself, and they with themselves, and you both just love each other for some ineffable reason, utterly and completely *as you are*. They will, inevitably, provide wonderful things, like safety, and comfort, and care, but you do not love them ***because*** they provide these things!!!

**2. Internalizing "There is the perception of infinity, rather than reality of it"**

I do not like feeling bad. I feel bad very often. Badness can manifest in a million different ways: as a steadfast belief that I am a failure, a never-ending stream of self-critical thoughts, a barrage of worries that I will never find love and be forever alone. It can also manifest in less legible, bodily ways: an intense tightness in the chest, a racing heartbeat that refuses to end, a restlessness in the arms that surfaces an urge to have them amputated.

Bad feelings are made worse by the belief that they are infinite. Even if I have ample evidence of my bad feelings eventually subsiding, when in them, I continuously do not believe that they will end. The Buddhists like to talk about impermanence, but I prefer a phrase a wise person once shared with me: "There is the perception of infinity, rather than the reality of it." This stuck with me, and I try to tell myself this each time I am going through a bad feeling. 

**3. Not flinching away**

Bad feelings also tend to pass more quickly if you actually feel them. 

"Bad feelings" often instinctively feel so bad that you subconsciously find a million ways to distract yourself from actually feeling them: you grow addicted to online chess, you succumb to YouTube shorts, you move countries - all rather than actually sitting and feeling the feeling you do not want to feel. I have spent years avoiding feelings. Most humans have. However, the pain of actually sitting with the thing you are avoiding is often far less painful than the suffering that emerges from avoiding this feeling. So, feel your feelings.

For illustration: when I feel a swell of jealous rage coming online, I will usually start crying and screaming and then quickly find as many ways as possible to avoid thinking about the thing causing me pain, i.e. flinching away. But what you can also do (in addition to crying and screaming, which I think is healthy and necessary) is: a) directly sit with the thoughts causing you pain - for example, perhaps you are picturing your ex falling in love with someone else. Keep picturing it! It will feel terrible! But it will end! And b) observe the physical sensations of jealousy arising in your body, wherever they may be (for me, usually in the heart area). It especially helps if you do so from a god-like perspective, treating your body as a scientific object of study. Often, when you actually sit with the feelings this way, you will notice that a) much of the "badness" is merely a perception, and can also be viewed as a blob of sensation-particles, and b) the collective sensation you are feeling will often start moving around in the body. When the sensations are done moving around in your body, you have done something called "processing an emotion." You basically need to keep doing this over, and over, and over again, until one day, you wake up, and no longer really feel triggered by this thing that once caused you terrible pain. 

**4. Not Dwelling in Misery**

I was born to feel things deeply. People tell me this is a beautiful gift, because I am in tune with what is *real*. But for most of my life, I've seen this as a curse, because this gift has mostly manifested in the form of frequent and horrific mood swings, panic spirals, manic episodes, and depressive bouts. And I find this quite unfair. When I see people's annual mood tracker data showing their average mood was an 8+ and they only had two days that reached as low as a 4, I wonder, what the fuck??? 1s and 2s are a commonplace occasion for me, and the few months that reached an average mood of 7 tend to be outliers.

When I am sad, there is this thing that happens where I want to believe that my sadness is somehow worse, or more severe, than other people's, because this provides me my pain with a meaningful narrative, thereby justifying my suffering. I often delight when people tell me, wow, it must be hard to feel as much as you do, or I can't imagine having gone through xyz. And I think this drive to somehow win at the game of sadness led me to wanting other people to feel bad for me. Perhaps over time, pity came to feel similar to care and love and attention. I have learnt, however, that the temporary care provided by pity is no match for the infinite and boundless care that you can provide yourself once you banish and do away with all your self-loathing. People feeling happy for your genuine happiness is much better than people feeling pity at your genuine sadness.

I believe, whilst much of my suffering is just a fact of life, and genetics, much of it is self-reinforcing, too. And so, I would like to complain less and broadcast my misery less. There is a beauty in being able to accept yourself as you are, including the inevitable sadness, and hold it with a knowing strength that it too, shall pass. In more blunt terms, I would like to do a better job of sucking it up and dealing with the cards I have been dealt. 

**5. Believing in Myself**

For most of my life, I have relied on other people believing in me in order to take any form of meaningful action in the world, because my own bouts of self-belief never lasted long enough. Self-belief often feels delusional to me. I use the word delusion to gesture towards those nagging ideas that your soul yearns to see through - that by societal standards may seem a bit odd, but are what you really want. I think you should try to do these things at all costs. And this will require self-belief. And it is worth it.

*The process of writing this blog post appears to have been surprisingly cathartic. In the days after, a strange feeling of robustness emerged within me. I went about my days, noticing all the triggers that usually would have set me off, yet felt somewhat impenetrable to them. I questioned whether I might be dissociating, decided it did not matter, and meditated on the remarkability of the human body to rewire itself and withstand great suffering.*
