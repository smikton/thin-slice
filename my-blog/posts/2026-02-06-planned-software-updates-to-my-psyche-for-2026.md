title: Planned software updates to my psyche for 2026

The psyche is surprisingly malleable, apparently. I hope to test this hypothesis this year, with plans to release the following product updates:

**1. Feeling genuine happiness for other people**

Much of my unhappiness stems from finding joy excruciating to witness. When I see someone share good news, achieve something impressive, or simply announce that they are enjoying life, I often feel incredibly, deeply sad. All good things point to some lack in me, resulting in this twisted dynamic where I often feel better knowing that other people are not doing that great.

This sucks. It especially sucks when trying to deal with heartbreak. My ex said he would feel deeply happy if I found love. I told him I would be utterly and absolutely devastated if he found love. This is quite normal, but also, I do not want to live this way.

I would like to be able to feel happy for other people. I would like for other people's good news to fuel me and a deeper optimism in humanity.

I believe this requires:

a) understanding that life is not a zero sum game; that good things are not finite. A good thing happening to someone else does not automatically imply that you are deficient in some important way.

b) loving yourself. Many things are downstream of wanting to feel loved. And many things *feel* like a reminder that you are not loved (an ex moving on, someone getting engaged while you are still single, etc.). If you are able to produce a constant reservoir of self-love somewhere deep within you, a belief that you really are okay in your current form, the pangs of sadness will not feel so bad, I imagine. This is also where God comes in. Apparently God loves you infinitely, as you are - that is quite something. 

**An apt example:** your partner provides you with safety; they make you feel loved. Your relationship ends, they move on, and fall in love with someone else. You feel a horrific, crushing pain, because your body interprets this as: you are not loved / you do not deserve love. The thing is, love is most pure when you do not cling to your partner, or to a thing they provide you, but when you are really okay with yourself, and they with themselves, and you both just love each other for some ineffable reason and are drawn to each other utterly and completely ***as you are*.** They will, inevitably, provide wonderful things, like safety, and comfort, and care, but you do not love them ***because*** they provide these things!!! 

**2. Internalizing "There is the perception of infinity, rather than reality of it"**

I do not like feeling bad. I feel bad very often. Badness manifests in a million different ways in me. In the mind, as panic, a never-ending stream of self-critical thoughts, as worries that I will be forever alone and sad and that I am a failure. It also manifests in less legible bodily ways: intense tightness in the chest, a racing heartbeat that refuses to end, an unending restlessness in the arms that makes me want to amputate them.

Bad feelings are made worse by the belief that they are infinite. Often, when I am in them, I do not believe they will end. Even if I have ample evidence of them eventually subsiding, I know they will return, and I do not want to live in a body that has to feel this bad this often. The Buddhists will tell you about impermanence, but a wise person told me in more lay terms: "There is the perception of infinity, rather than the reality of it." This stuck with me, and I try to tell myself this when I am going through a bad feeling.

**3. Not flinching away** 

Part of understanding that bad feelings are not infinite is actually feeling them.

"Bad feelings" are often so bad that you subconsciously find a million ways to distract yourself from looking at them: you play online chess, you watch YouTube videos, you move countries, all rather than actually sitting and feeling the feeling you do not want to feel. I have spent years avoiding feelings. Most humans have. However, the pain of actually sitting with the thing you are avoiding is often far less painful than the suffering that emerges from avoiding this feeling. So, feel your feelings.

A helpful trick for me has been realizing that I am not my feelings. Nor am I my thoughts. For example, when I feel a swell of jealous rage coming online, my instinct is to start crying and screaming and then find as many ways as possible to avoid thinking about the thing that is causing me pain. But what you can also do (in addition to crying and screaming, which I think is healthy and necessary) is observe the physical sensations of jealousy arising in the heart, in the chest, almost from a god-like perspective, imagining your body as a scientific object of study. Often, when you actually sit with the feelings this way, you will notice that a) they are not actually so bad b) they start moving around in the body. When the feelings are done shape-shifting, you have done something called "processing an emotion".

**4. Not Dwelling in Misery**

I am someone who was born to feel things deeply. People tell me this is a beautiful gift, because I am in tune with *what is real*, but for most of my life I've seen it as a curse. I am victim to quite frequent horrific mood swings, panic spirals, manic episodes and depressive bouts. And I find this quite unfair. When I see people's annual mood tracker data showing their average mood was an 8+ and they only had two days that reached as low as a 4, I wonder, what the fuck??? 1s and 2s are a commonplace occasion for me, and the few months that reached an average mood of 7 were genuine outliers.

I realized, recently, that I want other people to feel bad for me. Perhaps because pity feels like care and love, or attention, I am not sure, but this is not a good long-term strategy. The temporary care provided by pity is no match for the infinite care that rests within you once you banish and do away with all your self-loathing.

I believe, whilst much of my suffering is just a fact of life, and genetics, and the way I am, much of it is self-reinforcing, too. And so, I would like to complain less and broadcast my misery less. There is a beauty in being able to accept yourself as you are, including the inevitable sadness, and hold it with a knowing strength that it too is temporary. In more blunt terms, I want to do a better job of sucking it up and dealing with what I have.

When I am sad, there is this thing that happens, that I want to believe that my sadness is somehow worse, or more severe than other people's because this would then somehow justify the suffering, because at least it would rank on some podium somewhere. I get a wierd delight when people tell me, you feel things so deeply, or it must be hard to feel as much as you do xyz. It gives some narrative to make the pain feel meaningful. But I also think, one can try to simply let go of narratives. 

**5. Believing in Myself**

For most of my life, I have relied on other people believing in me in order to take any form of meaningful action in the world, because my bouts of self-belief never lasted long enough. Self-belief often feels delusional to me. I use the word delusion to gesture towards these nagging ideas that your soul yearns to realize, that by societal standards may seem a bit odd, but it's what you really want. I basically think you should try to do this thing at all costs. And this will require self-belief. And it is worth it.

\*\**

The process of writing this blog post appears to have been suprisingly cathartic. In the days after, a strange feeling of robustness emerged. I went about my days - I noticed all the usual triggers that usually would have set me off, and I simply did not care for them. I questioned whether I might be dissociating, but alas, I think I am just fine and it is okay to be fine and how wonderful it feels to be a human todoya.
