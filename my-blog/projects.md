Adding a page to your blog called "projects" forces you to ask: what have I done with my life? Not much, it appears. The project of life has demanded enough of my attention.

I kid, only slightly. I have done a few things here and there: 

* As a kid, I used to make [experimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RrmcCKTPVk) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1rc-0CH3Y) on youtube, scoring them on garageband. 
* I created a group chat with nearly ~100 people called "Daily Poll" and sent one poll a day for 468 days. I am in the process of writing a recap. 
* I started this blog. 
* I built a chrome extension that allows you to view the YouTube home feed through the eyes of different personas. 
* My friend Alex & I designed an app called "Betsy" where you and your friends can bet on each other's life outcomes.
